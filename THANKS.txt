- Alexey "DataGreed" Strelkov
    - For creating the original `docstring-coverage` library (https://bitbucket.org/DataGreed/docstring-coverage)
    - Support seems to have ended on 2012-08-14. Hopefully I'm not stepping on any toes by picking up where you left off
    - Thank you for your excellent work, and just as you say you owe James Harlow a drink, I owe you one, as well
- James Harlow
    - For authoring the 2004 "Docstring Coverage Python Recipe" (http://code.activestate.com/recipes/355731/)
    - Credited by Alexey Strelkov as being the basis of `docstring-coverage`
    - Thank you. Obviously, I also owe you a drink
